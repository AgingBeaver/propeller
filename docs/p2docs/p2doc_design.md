### Design Status

| Date | Progress |  
|------|----------|  
|2018_04_25|Verilog design files sent to On Semi for Rev A silicon (8 cogs, 512KB hub, 64 smart pins)|  
|2018_05_29|Final ROM data sent to On Semi|  
|2018_07_09|Final Sign-off with On Semi, reticles being made|  
|2018_09_11|Wafers done! Only took 9 weeks, instead of 14.|  
|2018_09_27|Received 10 glob-top prototype chips from On Semi.<br/><br/>Chips are functional, but sign-extension problems in Verilog source files caused the following problems:<br/><br/><ol><li>Cogs' IQ modulators' outputs are nonsensical.</li><li>Smart pin measurement modes which are supposed to count by +1/-1 are counting by +1/+3.</li><li>ALTx instructions aren't sign-extending S[17:09] before adding into D.</li></ol>These sign-extension problems have already been fixed in the Verilog source files and tested on the FPGA.<br/><br/>There is also a low-glitch-on-high-to-float problem on some I/O pins due to a race condition between DIR and OUT signals. This will be fixed by timing constraints in the next silicon.<br/><br/>A respin of the silicon is planned after more testing.|  
|2018_11_13|Received 135 Amkor-packaged prototype chips from On Semi. These chips will have better heat dissipation than the glob-top prototypes.|  
|2019_04_11|Rev B respin entered the fab and is due out July 15.<br/><br/>Ten glob-top prototypes should arrive on August 1, with 2,400 production chips to follow in a few weeks.<br/><br/>The following improvements were made to the chip:<br/><br/><ul><li>All known prior bugs fixed.</li><li>Clock-gating implemented, reduces power by ~40%.</li><li>PLL filter modified to reduce jitter and improve lock.</li><li>System counter extended to 64 bits. GETCT WC retrieves upper 32-bits.</li><li>Streamer has many new modes with SINC1/SINC2 ADC conversions for Goertzel mode.</li><li>HDMI mode added to streamer with ascending and descending pinouts for easy PCB layout.</li><li>SINC2/SINC3 filters added to smart pins for improving ENOB in ADC conversions.</li><li>Each cog has four 8-bit sample-per-clock ADC channels that feed from new smart pin 'SCOPE' modes.</li><li>BITL/BITH/BITC/BITNC/BITZ/BITNZ/BITRND/BITNOT can now work on a span of bits (+S[9:5] bits). Prior SETQ overrides S[9:5].</li><li>DIRx/OUTx/FLTx/DRVx can now work on a span of pins (+D[10:6] pins). Prior SETQ overrides D[10:6].</li><li>WRPIN/WXPIN/WYPIN/AKPIN can now work on a span of pins (+S[10:6] pins). Prior SETQ overrides S[10:6].</li><li>BIT_DAC output now has two 4-bit settings for low and high states, instead of one 8-bit high-state setting.</li><li>RDxxxx/WRxxxx+PTRx expressions now index -16..+16 with updating and -32..+31 without updating.</li><li>Sensible PTRx behavior implemented for 'SETQ(2) + RDLONG/WRLONG/WMLONG' operations.</li><li>RDLUT/WRLUT can now handle PTRx expressions.</li><li>Cog LUT sharing is now glitch-free.</li><li>POP now returns Z=1 if result=0, used to return result[30].</li><li>XORO32 improved.</li><li>Main PRNG upgraded to "Xoroshiro128**".<br/><br/>The core logic increased by a net 15%, even with significant logic reductions resulting from clock-gating. Fortunately, ON Semi was able to make it all fit within the original die area.|
