# Docs Folder
This folder contains the source for the entire https://propeller.parallax.com website.  It is expected to grow in size (files/folders) as more content is created and shared.

The site is hosted via GitHub Pages, generated and served by Jekyll.  The parent folder named 'docs' is required by the GitHub Pages service as the website's root folder in the repository.

## Files and Folders
* ```index.html``` - this file is the site's home page
* ```/assets``` - Various site resources (such as graphic files) are stored here
