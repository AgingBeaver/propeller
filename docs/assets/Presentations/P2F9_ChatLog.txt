15:14:56 Jim Granville : The text says topvalue bottomvalue, but the examples show -128 128 - is one of those backwards ? Seems -128 is bottomvalue ? + 128 is topvalue ?
15:21:05 Francis Bauer : Can you display the data with persistance?
15:21:45 Stephen Moraco : Iâ€™m thinking logic analyzer display would be funâ€¦
15:23:05 Francis Bauer : Cool
15:23:07 Ken Gracey : For those who joined late, the Pnut is here http://forums.parallax.com/discussion/171196/pnut-spin2-latest-version-v34v-graphical-debugger/p1
15:25:33 Jim Kenney : Pnut worked on WIN 7 and Win10  without Virus detection!
15:26:01 Ken Gracey : Somehow, 30 mins before this meeting, Chip seems to have overcome the virus blockers. I also installed successfully. 
15:27:29 Francis Bauer : Polar coordinates
15:29:13 Jim Kenney : I'm sure Jeff had a lot to do with it.
15:30:41 Jeff Martin : re: virus - I did a lot of praying. :-)
15:31:07 Jim Granville : Can the terminal have a title string ?
15:32:28 Eric Smith : Instead of debug() commands, could you not equally well use send() with a serial transmit method to get these plots?
15:32:53 Ken Gracey : Seems we could use this with P1 too.
15:34:34 Ken Gracey : "special thing" YES! 
15:35:42 Jon McPhalen : I often use a spare Spin cog in the P1 to send data to a terminal, so it would be really nice to have this for the P1.
15:36:11 Ken Gracey : I'm wondering if it could also be stand-alone, like PST, for use with C/Python/Forth/etc
15:36:23 Francis Bauer : Way cool, these features are more than just for debugging
15:37:03 Jeff Martin : Right!  It could potentially be used for normal runtime application usage.
15:37:05 Jon McPhalen : Would be nice if this was open sourced so that developers could create clones for other operating systems.
15:38:12 Carroll Moore : Why in Delphi?
15:38:33 Eric Smith : If the compiler is doing the parser, then how can we do this on P1?
15:38:44 Jim Granville : Embarcadero claim to have delphis for MAC and Linux, but I've not tried using them ?
15:39:20 Jeff Martin : They work.  I've tried them.  Android and iOS too.
15:40:13 Stephen Moraco : Chip looks very easy to use. Good work!
15:40:28 Jim Granville : "They work.  I've tried them.  Android and iOS too.' - sounds like you volumterred to do a iOS version ? ;)
15:41:28 Ken Gracey : Do we need this as a stand-alone application for use with Mu, Flexgui?
15:50:11 Ken Gracey : I'd like to get accurate tone recognition from Bb clarinet. 
15:50:50 Jim Granville : Chip said the PC side struggles to keep up, so faster comms is going to be no magic bullet. FS USB limits you to a few MBd (3-6-8Mbd) and HS USB UARTS liimit to 12-15MBd, to go above that you need to jump from UARTS to something else.. It would be nice to find a 50+MBd HS-USB bridge, but no one does that ?
15:51:02 Robert Lawrence : Yes ken Pitch detection can open many windows :)
15:52:11 Ken Gracey : Helping Chip move from Delphi by porting his code to other tools => A+ we really appreciate it Gerold.
15:54:26 Eric Smith : A good start to porting this would be to convert the debug() statements to just jm_serial str() method calls... that would show what's parser dependent
15:56:57 Jim Granville : Display options: multimeters added a bar graph to the digital display > a decade ago, so a terminal mode that included a simple bar-graph above or below the larger text would be a nice extension. Multiple 'multimeters' can then be placed on a PC. 
15:58:46 Stephen Moraco : Wild thoughtâ€¦ p2d2 as RPi hat with RPi doing hi res display?  we need to investigate data xfer speeds from P2D2 to RPi...
15:58:58 Jeff Martin : re: "I'm wondering if it could also be stand-alone, like PST, for use with C/Python/Forth/etc
         " - It could be.  Catching the start of the debug stream when/if the port is being shared, is the biggest issue, but with the DEBUG_DELAY feature Chip already put it, it makes it much more practical as a stand-alone.
15:59:05 Peter Jakacki : P2LAB is a standalone dev system with extra P2D2 or custom proto P2 option.
16:03:37 Jim Granville : Re "we need to investigate data xfer speeds from P2D2 to RPi..." - there are HW ans SW issues here, this from a Pi froum : "we need to investigate data xfer speeds from P2D2 to RPi..."
16:04:10 Jim Granville : oops.."Pi forum: "The UART itself has no throughput limitations in fact it can run up to 32 Mega baud. But doing so requires
         significant CPU involvement as it has shallow FIFOs and no DMA support."
16:06:23 Stephen Moraco : I have working LKMs (loadable kernal modules) on RPi so having better speeds can be achievedâ€¦ with the various forms of IO
16:06:47 Stephen Moraco : I can even dedicate one of the cores to the LKM...
16:07:41 Stephen Moraco : All while running unmodified RPi OSâ€¦ these are just runtime add-ins.
16:08:02 Eric Smith : Getting everything in Delphi (or at least out of the x86 parser) would really help
16:08:07 Robert Lawrence : yes 
16:10:56 Stephen Moraco : Basically, Peter, I canâ€™t wait to playâ€¦   ;-)
16:11:04 Robert Lawrence : CHiip, I just downloaded Pnut and ran it and it
16:11:15 Robert Lawrence : it's working great
16:11:26 Jeff Martin : Thanks Robert.
16:11:33 Robert Lawrence : :)
16:12:30 Jim Kenney : PNUT ran great. Thanks Jeff and Chip!
16:13:22 Robert Lawrence : Chip It can be converted to Javsscript also with Quartex the Pascal compiler and can be run the web browser :)
16:13:35 Jim Granville : How much x86 is there ?
16:13:35 Robert Lawrence : yes
16:18:43 Chip Gracey : There is about 500 lines, total, of x86 code.
16:23:36 Robert Lawrence : In a few months or so we can have a meeting to see what everyone converted Pnut to :)
16:24:35 Carroll Moore : I used something like that for robot control 
16:25:02 Robert Lawrence : yes
16:25:05 Francis Bauer : yes
16:25:25 Carroll Moore : x axis was rotation direction and speed
16:25:40 Carroll Moore : y axis was forward / backward and speed
16:25:49 Jim Granville : Yes, a function generator and capturing that should work nicely with the graphical debg too...
16:26:11 Jonathan Titus : Thanks Chip and Ken.  More good information for us. --Jon
16:26:34 Peter Jakacki : Thanks Chip, thanks everyone
16:26:37 Stephen Moraco : Excellent Chip, thank you!
16:26:43 Eric Smith : Thanks, Chip!
16:26:43 Jeff Martin : Thanks Chip!
16:26:49 Jim Kenney : Great zoom!
16:27:05 Robert Lawrence : Excellent CHip , Wow!! cool stuff :)
16:30:10 Stephen Moraco : Chip MSO Scope?  4 analog, 16 digital?
16:31:13 Ken Gracey : https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Analog-Devices/ADALM-PLUTO?qs=xbccQsLEe0ffoUoi%2FjfIWA%3D%3D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMyFnumW6wIVtvzjBx3wygDrEAQYASABEgJAJPD_BwE
16:32:44 Stephen Moraco : My favorite cheap analyzer comes from here (open source) https://www.ikalogic.com/
16:32:52 Chris Wardell : The PLUTO is an SDR device
16:33:10 Chris Wardell : Thanks Chip
16:33:14 Jim Kenney : Thanks Chip!
