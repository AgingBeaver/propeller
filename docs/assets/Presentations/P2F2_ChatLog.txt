08:18:36 Whit Stodghill : Luckily, we have lots of pins with the P2. ;-)
08:18:44 Robert Lawrence : This site can't be reachedforums's server IP address could not be found.
08:19:28 Whit Stodghill : Nice!
08:27:18 Whit Stodghill : Cool!
08:36:16 Ken Gracey : Question from Facebook Live for Ray or Chip from Matteo Borri Is it possible to connect a USB webcam and get frames in, or else to get frames in from a composite video source - like a heads up display for an FPV drone?
08:43:19 Jon McPhalen : Well done, Ray.
08:43:20 Whit Stodghill : Great job RAY!
08:43:33 Jeff Martin : Fantastic job, Ray!
08:43:35 Robert Lawrence : Excellent Ray Thanks :)
08:43:37 Peter Jakacki : Good presentation Ray
08:43:44 Chip Gracey : Matteo, not sure. If the camera could signal using the 12 Mbps full-speed USB that the smart pins support, then you could get data, but only at a low frame rate. I believe USB cameras signal using USB 2.0 or higher.
08:43:45 Thomas Talbot : I hope this will be posted later since I joined late.  The parts I saw were excellent.
08:44:24 Mike Green : Thanks, Ray.  Great slides
08:44:42 Dennis Gately : Great job, Ray!
08:45:24 Samuel Lourenço : Good job, Ray!
08:45:33 Chip Gracey : Good job, Ray! I missed the first part, but will review it later. Looks very nice.
08:46:31 Dennis Gately : Can you recommend minimal video display requirements for your drivers?
08:46:50 Samuel Lourenço : USB 1.1 is limited to 12Mbps, or about 1.5MBps, which is not enough for video.
