# Libraries Folder
This folder contains Propeller 1 and Propeller 2 library (object) code developed and shared by the Propeller Community.  Much of this code comes from the decommissioned Propeller Object Exchange.

## Looking for OBEX (Propeller Object Exchange) Files?
The ["p1" (Propeller 1)](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/tree/master/libraries/community/p1) subfolders contain object code migrated from the Propeller Object Exchange.  See the [community/p1/All](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/tree/master/libraries/community/p1/All) folder (for example), or the other p1 subfolders the find categorized objects.

## Contents and Structure
As further Propeller 1 objects are created, or as the Propeller 2 is tested and further materials are developed, the "p1" and "p2" folder contents should evolve organically to stay organized- items categorized in subfolders.

Contributors can [create](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/wiki/Contributing) and/or [suggest](mailto\\:developer+github@parallax.com?subject=Propeller+Repository+Suggestion) new or renamed subfolders when the need arises.
