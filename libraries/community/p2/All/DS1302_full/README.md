# DS1302_full

By: "dgately" based on BR's original in P1 Object repo

Language: Spin2

Created: 03-JAN-2021

Category: protocol, sensor

Description:
A full-featured DS1302 timekeeping chip driver. Based on the original Propeller 1 object by BR.

I've converted DS1302_full.spin from the old OBEX to DS1302_full.spin2. This code compiles on PropTool 2.4.1 for P2 as well as in flexprop (version 5.0.5 beta). A demo/example is included.
