Description:
This driver provides control of the APA102C smart pixel (2 wire, data and clock) which is favored by some over the WS2812 due to higher communications speed and faster internal PWM (this is especially popular in the film and television business). Advanced controls allow the application to switch LED buffers for animations effects, and to switch output pin groups for multi-output applications.
