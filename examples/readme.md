# Examples Folder
This folder contains Propeller 2 example code developed and shared by the Propeller Community.  

## Contents and Structure
As the Propeller 2 is tested and further materials are developed, this folder and it's contents should evolve organically to stay organized- items categorized in subfolders.

Contributors can create and/or suggest new or renamed subfolders when the need arises.  
As an initial guide, a subfolder structure similar to that developed for Parallax's Simple Libraries may serve as inspiration for use here.
