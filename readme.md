## This Repository Uses Git LFS
Most content in this repository is source code that Git excels at storing and versioning efficiently; however, some resources (like graphic and data files) are not as compatible.  This repository uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) to include those resources in an efficient manner and __you need Git LFS installed__ to fully access those resources from a local repo clone. 

LFS has long been a Git add-on but now is automatically included with the latest [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installers.

The same may not hold true for other platforms; for example, on Mac, first [install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) then [install LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation#mac-osx).
